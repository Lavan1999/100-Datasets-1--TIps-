About the analysis


The analysis conducted explores the tipping behavior and potential correlations within a dataset containing
information from restaurant transactions. The dataset includes various variables such as total bill amount, 
tip amount, customer demographics (e.g., sex, smoker status), and dining details (e.g., day of the week, time of day, party size).

The analysis begins with an exploration of correlations between different variables, utilizing statistical methods
such as Pearson correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). These methods aim to
uncover potential relationships or dependencies between continuous and categorical variables.

Following the correlation analysis, the investigation extends to hypothesis testing. Two-sample t-tests are employed to 
compare means of continuous variables, such as total bill amount and tip amount, while chi-square tests and ANOVA are
used to analyze relationships between categorical variables.

The hypotheses tested include assertions about the equality of means or distributions within various groups, such as
differences in tipping behavior between male and female customers or variations in total bill amounts across different 
days of the week.

Additionally, the analysis includes visualizations, such as bar plots, to provide intuitive insights into the data. These
visualizations aid in interpreting the relationships between variables and allow for easier communication of findings.

Overall, the analysis aims to uncover patterns, dependencies, and insights within the dataset that could be valuable for
businesses in the service industry, particularly restaurants, in understanding customer behavior and optimizing operational 
strategies.
